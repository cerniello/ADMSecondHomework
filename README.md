The purpose of the project was to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis and answer below-mentioned research questions on a data collected from [Yellow cabs data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) (January-June 2018).

The repository consists of the following files:
1. __`ADM_HW2_Full.ipynb`__: 
	> A Jupyter notebook which provides the solutions to all research questions. 
	
		Exploratory Data Analysis
			1. [RQ1]: In what period of the year Taxis are used more?  
			
			2. [RQ2]: What are the time slots with more passengers?  

			3. [RQ3]: Do all trips last the same?

			4. [RQ4]: What is the most common way of payments?  

			5. [RQ5]: Does a long distance correlate with the duration of the trip on average?  

		Core Research Questions 
			1. [CRQ1]: Does the fare for kilometer change across NY's borough?  
			
			2. [CRQ2]: Visualize Taxis movements!
2. __`functions.py`__:
	> A python script which provides all the functions used in the `ADM_HW2_Full.ipynb` notebook.

3. __map_starts.html__:
	> A HTML file with a map of NY zones that shows the number of trips that starts in each zone. [CRQ2]

4. __map_ends.html__:
	> A HTML file with a map of NY zones that shows the number of trips that ends in the single zone. [CRQ2]
